# JustSayIt Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
JustSayIt is a cross-platform, hotkey-driven accessibility tool that provides text-to-speech (TTS) and on-screen optical character recognition (OCR) capabilities. It operates entirely offline using local, open-weight models for privacy and performance.

## Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.9+
- **GUI Framework**: PyQt6 
- **ML Framework**: PyTorch/Transformers (Hugging Face)
- **Audio**: sounddevice for cross-platform playback
- **Hotkeys**: pynput for global hotkey detection
- **Screen Capture**: Pillow + platform-specific optimizations
- **Configuration**: YAML with schema validation
